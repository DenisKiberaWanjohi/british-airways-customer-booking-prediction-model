# British Airways Customer Booking â€” Predictive Model With Streamlit UI

## ðŸ§­ Overview / Problem Statement

British Airways aims to improve conversion rates by identifying customers likely to complete a booking.  
This model analyzes historical booking data to predict completion likelihood, helping the airline target follow-up campaigns or special offers more effectively.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Build a machine learning model to predict booking completion  
- Identify key drivers influencing booking decisions  
- Provide an interactive interface for real-time and batch predictions  

---

## ðŸ§© Features

- End-to-end training pipeline (data preprocessing â†’ model training â†’ artifact export)  
- Streamlit dashboard for real-time scoring and visualization  
- Automated feature type detection and transformation  
- Configurable target and feature columns

    â””â”€â”€ feature_info.json          # Saved at training time to drive the UI
```

## Data

Expected file: `data/customer_booking.csv`. The default target is `booking_complete` with values 0 or 1. Adjust the `TARGET_COL` in `src/train_pipeline.py` if your column differs.

## Using the UI

You can enter values in a form for a single prediction or upload a CSV for batch predictions. The app uses the saved pipeline, so run training first if the artifacts are missing.

## Included artifacts

This repo includes a trained example model so the app runs immediately:

- `models/pipeline.pkl`
- `models/feature_info.json`
